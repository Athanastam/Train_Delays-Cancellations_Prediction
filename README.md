The files provided are step by step the coding proccess for this project, Merging of the datasets, Arima and Transformer models for delay forecasting,
 Decision Tree and Random Forest for cancellation prediction. The predictions of the models concerning cancellations are also provided as this code had run
  in a cluster for time and resources efficiency. Weather conditions datasets are also provided but the dataset concerning train records is too big to upload on GitHub.
